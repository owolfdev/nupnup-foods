## Strategic Context

These brands define three clear segments:

1. **Commodity sweetness** (corn-syrup breakfast products)
2. **Authenticity upgrade** (real maple)
3. **Health alternative** (agave)

Any coconut- or palm-based syrup entering this space competes **across all three**, depending on how it is positioned: indulgence, authenticity, or health.
