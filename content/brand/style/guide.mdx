## **2. Texture Style**

The defining look of Thai Nectar is **hand-crafted and human**, modeled on Thai street signage and hand-painted food stall boards.

## **Chosen Texture Characteristics**

**Rough-edged paint strokes** Imperfect edges, variable brush pressure.

**Mild distressing** Slight inconsistencies that suggest hand lettering—not digital grunge.

**Matte, non-gloss paint look** Avoid shiny or vector-clean edges.

**Thai hand-painted signage influence** The style should echo:

- white lettering brushed by hand,
- lively placement of text,
- loosely centered compositions.

### **Texture Direction**

**Not**: Vintage Americana, chalkboard, retro-distressed grunge.
**Yes**: Thai hand-written market signs, busy red-white condiment labels, temple donation boards.

---

## **3. Typography System**

Because the label is hand-painted, typography is divided into two systems:

1. Display (hand-painted)
2. Supporting (body/systems)

### **3.1 Display Type (Primary)**

Used for:

- “COCONUT SYRUP”
- “Thai Nectar”
- Feature phrases (“100% Natural”, “Low GI”, etc.)

**Requirements:**

- Hand-painted brush style
- Tall, bold, condensed letters
- Slight irregularity in alignment
- Thick strokes with softened corners
- No perfect geometry

This type is _always white_, never outlined, to stay consistent with the painted-on aesthetic.

### **3.2 Body Type (Secondary)**

Used for back labels, website text, small captions, or usage descriptions.

Recommended Fonts:

- **Inter Sans**
- **IBM Plex Sans**
- **Noto Sans Thai (if Thai language needed)**

Tone:

- Clean
- Functional
- Neutral
  This contrast highlights the handmade character of the display type.

## **5. Illustration System**

### **5.1 Core Motif: Coconut Blossom Line Art**

This appears under or beside the primary text.

Style:

- Simple
- One-color (white)
- No shading
- Slightly uneven hand-drawn quality
- Small starburst / radiating petal symmetry

### **5.2 Supporting Marks**

Optional micro-illustrations:

- Dashes
- Radiating lines
- Dotted separators
  All should feel hand-painted and lively.

### **5.3 Negative Space Strategy**

The brand embraces _busy layouts_ with:

- layered text
- micro-phrases filling space
- small icons or dashes
  but maintains readability through consistent white paint strokes.

---

## **6. Label Layout Principles**

### **Hierarchy**

1. **COCONUT SYRUP** — largest, centered
2. **Thai Nectar** — secondary, above
3. Benefit Claims — smaller text blocks around the perimeter
4. Blossom illustration — center or midline divider
5. “100% Natural | Low GI” — lower third
6. Net Weight — smallest, bottom

### **Spacing**

- Tight spacing is intentional—crowded but coherent.
- Avoid overly symmetrical layout; controlled chaos is part of the charm.

---

## **7. Tone & Messaging**

### **Brand Voice**

- Warm
- Honest
- Artisanal but not pretentious
- Thai roots without cliché

### **Example Messaging Words**

- Crafted
- Natural
- Low GI
- Traditional
- Coconut blossom
- Thailand
- Pure

Tone should remain matter-of-fact and grounded—consistent with your preferred communication style.

## **8. Packaging & Photography Direction**

### **Lighting**

- Soft warm diffused
- High-end tabletop photography
- Beige backdrop to complement syrup color

### **Bottle Styling**

- Transparent bottle so syrup color becomes part of the palette
- White paint directly on plastic—no labels
- Red cap as signature visual identity
